## 🚀 Why This Project Matters
Real estate data is fragmented, inconsistent, and often unstructured.  
This pipeline turns that chaos into **clean, structured, and actionable intelligence**, complete with:  

- **Automated data ingestion** from property sites  
- **High-quality structured storage** (PostgreSQL + ORM)  
- **Analytics & insights** (affordable/expensive listings, trends)  
- **Predictive intelligence** via a trained ML model  
- **Production-grade observability** (Prometheus + Grafana)  
- **Fully containerized & CI/CD ready**  

This documentation explains every layer in detail, from scraping to predictions to monitoring.

## 👤 About the Author  

This pipeline was designed and engineered by **Lewis**, a Data Engineer committed to building **production-grade, enterprise-ready systems**.  

The **Property Intelligence Pipeline** demonstrates expertise across:  
- **Data Engineering** → scalable ingestion, transformation, and storage  
- **Machine Learning Integration** → predictive modeling for property insights  
- **Observability & Monitoring** → metrics, alerting, and enterprise reliability  
- **Cloud-Native Deployment** → AWS-based architecture built for resilience  

Lewis’s mission is to design data systems that are **scalable, observable, and business-impact driven**.  
This project is both a **portfolio piece** and a **blueprint for real-world enterprise pipelines**.
