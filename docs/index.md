## 🚀 Why This Project Matters
Real estate data is fragmented, inconsistent, and often unstructured.  
This pipeline turns that chaos into **clean, structured, and actionable intelligence**, complete with:  

- **Automated data ingestion** from property sites  
- **High-quality structured storage** (PostgreSQL + ORM)  
- **Analytics & insights** (affordable/expensive listings, trends)  
- **Predictive intelligence** via a trained ML model  
- **Production-grade observability** (Prometheus + Grafana)  
- **Fully containerized & CI/CD ready**  

This documentation explains every layer in detail, from scraping to predictions to monitoring.
